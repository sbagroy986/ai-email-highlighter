# llm-email-scanner

## Description
A Chrome extension built to help highlight emails you don't want to miss. The extension aims to manage the overflow of emails, newsletters, and articles that can be overwhelming to sort through. 

## Capabilities and Usage
Details on the extension's capabilities and how to use it will be provided shortly.

## Personal Note
This project is stemming from my recent inability to keep up with my personal email account. I receive too many emails, newsletters and articles for me to look through them consistently, and I am hoping this extension can help with some of it. More broadly, this is a small way for me to start tackling the larger problem that modernity/technology has introduced; there is too much information out there, what should I consume?

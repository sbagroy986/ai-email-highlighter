To use the extension, create your own OpenAI API key from their [portal](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).


## Personal Note
This project is stemming from my recent inability to keep up with my personal email account. I receive too many emails, newsletters and articles for me to look through them consistently, and I am hoping this extension can help with some of it. More broadly, this is a small way for me to start tackling the larger problem that modernity/technology has introduced; there is too much information out there, what should I consume?
